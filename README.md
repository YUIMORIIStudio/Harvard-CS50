# ⛺️ CS50x_2023_Harvard 

## Introduction to Computer Science

This is CS50, Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.

## Disclaimer

> A quick word on [Academic Honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/honesty/). While these solutions will help you to get through the course without too much effort, you should do your best to figure out a working solution yourself before taking a look at any of my solutions. Investing your time and energy into solving the problem sets yourself is in my opinion the only way to eventual mastery. Go ahead and take a peek at the solutions, and remember to have fun.

## Introduction To Computer Science

> This course teaches you how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience.
